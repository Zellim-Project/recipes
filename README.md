## What are "Recipes"?

Recipes are small scripts that are responsible for providing the connection between your services (e.g. WhatsApp, GMail or Slack) and Zellim. It provides Zellim information like the number of current notifications, handles enabling dark mode and may otherwise improve your experience with the service.

Each time you create a new service inside Zellim, Zellim will automatically install and execute the recipe associated with that service.
